# Letterboxd to Plex
## Summary

As its name says: **Letterboxd to Plex** will import your (pre exported) Letterboxd watchlist to Plex. Since Plex does not offer the watchlist feature since the beginning, I started to create my own as a playlist some time ago. Somehow I still prefer that playlist style to the newer builtin feature.

Somewhat similar to [PlexImportWatchlist](https://github.com/techkek/PlexImportWatchlist).

This script will also support the default watchlist. Read `Other features` and `Configuration` for further information.

Also, that project and its code is pretty messy at its current state and really needs refactoring.


## üöÄ Quick start

1. Install needed third party libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Open file `config.py` and edit the fields `baseurl`, as well as `token`. You can retrieve your token by following the [official Plex support article](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

2.1 **_Optional_**: Change other settings in `config.py` (see section `Configuration`).

3. Export your personal data from [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/data/export/). You can also do this by navigating to your Letterboxd settings page and click on `Import & Export`. This will download a zip file, containing all your data.

4. Extract data and copy the files `watched.csv`, `watchlist.csv` and `ratings.csv` next to `main.py`.

Or else you can also:

3.1 Update `config.py` and set the field `use_api` to `True`. Also update fields `api_username` and `api_password` to download the zip file automatically.

5. Run `python main.py` with param `-w`


## ‚ùì Other information

- You decide whether this script will use the default watchlist or create a brand-new playlist. If there is another playlist that you have created previously, you can also skip the movies that were already added to that existing list.
- Letterboxd lists some TV shows also. Since this script only supports movies, it will exclude those shows and saves them in a file called `ignore.json`. This will skip those shows and prevents unnecessary API calls in the future.
- You will add movies to your watchlist that are not on your Plex server yet. This script will add all missing movies to a file called `missing.json`.
- Unfortunately Plex' search feature is not perfect. Sometimes a search query will find more than one movie in your collection. This script will ask you which of your movies is the correct one. After that it will memorize your decision and stops to ask when running the script again. This information is stored in a file called `autoselection.json`. You can also enter "0" when it asks for the mapping to skip the procedure (e.g. movie is not present but search still finds movies).
- Since Letterboxd stores all of its information in English, this script may encounter difficulties in finding foreign language movies. You can map those movies yourself and this script will find them in the next run. The most easy way is to cut the entry from `missing.json` and copy it to `mapping.json`. Besides that, you have to enter the correct titles. Take a look to `Examples`. Take a look at `TMDB`.

#### üì∫ TMDB

The Movie DB is the great website Letterboxd is getting its metadata from. They also provide an API you can use to look up metadata yourself.
You can use the API to map movies Plex cannot find automatically (take a look at `Other information`). Long story short: This will avoid creating 
a `mapping.json` file.  
You have to create a TMDB account and claim an [API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) key. Set `tmdb_use_api` to `True`
and set your setting `tmdb_api_key` to your received Bearer Token.  
I recommend to set `tmdb_cache` to `True` to minimize traffic and API calls.

| **tmdb_cache**                 | If True: Cache all requests and store them to a local database                                          |
| **tmdb_invalidate_cache**      | If True: Will remove cached requests after X days                                                       |
| **tmdb_invalidate_cache_days** | Amount of days after the cached requests will get deleted                                               |     
| **tmdb_api_key**               | Your TMDB bearer token                                                                                  |

## Script parameters

| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **-w** / **--watchlist**             | Creates a watchlist on Plex, based on your Letterboxd watchlist                                                                                                                                  |
| **-o** [value] / **--owned** [value] | **Letterboxd Pro-feature**: Creates a CSV-file of your movies to import to Letterboxd. The optional parameter [value] will only export an amount of movies, otherwise it will export all movies. |
| **-r** / **--rating**                | Imports your letterboxd movie ratings to your local library                                                                                                                                      |


### Parameter `owned`

**Only possible if you are a letterboxd pro member!**  
This will create a csv file that you can import to a list on letterboxd, showing you if you own a movie or not. Take a look at
For further information, take a look at Letterboxd FAQ, section [How do I keep track of films I own?](https://letterboxd.com/about/faq/).


### Parameter `rating`

This option will import your set rating from letterboxd to your local Plex library. Additionally, this will store all ratings to a local sqlite database to improve speed, so only new ratings will get imported.



## Used libraries

[PlexAPI](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi/)

[tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)


## Examples

`ignore_words = True` will produce the following output:
```
- Desperado
- The Disaster Artist
- Dogville
```
Instead of
```
- Desperado
- Dogville
- The Disaster Artist
```

---

Map foreign language movies in `mapping.json`. You can also add the year of the movie if needed:
```
[
   {
      "letterboxd_title": "Head-On",
      "plex_title": "Gegen die Wand"
   },
   {
      "letterboxd_title": "Portrait of a Lady on Fire",
      "plex_title": "Portrait de la jeune fille en feu"
   },
   {
      "letterboxd_title": "Hercules in New York",
      "plex_title": "Hercules in New York",
      "year": 1975
  }
]
```
